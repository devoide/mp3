# mp3 Player for Windows

## Overview
This project was created out of frustration with YouTube's music mixer, which often suggests songs I don't like. I wanted a simple and customizable solution to listen to **my own downloaded music files**, without dealing with unwanted recommendations.

## Features
- Play your downloaded music files seamlessly.
- Lightweight and easy-to-use interface.
- No ads, no algorithms – just your music.

## Why I Built This
Streaming platforms and automated mixers like YouTube’s can sometimes miss the mark, throwing in songs that disrupt the vibe. I wanted full control over my listening experience, with a tool that simply plays the music I choose.

## How to Use
1. **Download the Setup File**:  
   Head to the [Releases](./releases) section of this repository and download the latest setup file.

2. **Install and Run**:  
   Run the setup file to install the program on your device. Once installed, launch the application.

3. **Add Your Music Folders**:  
   - Navigate to the **Folder** tab in the application.
   - Add folders containing your music files. The player will automatically index and list your songs.

4. **Play Your Music**:  
   - Go to the **Player** tab to see your music library.
   - Use the playback controls (e.g., Play, Next, Previous, shuffle) to enjoy your music.

No complicated settings or extra steps – just download, add your folders, and start listening
