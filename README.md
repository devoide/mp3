# mp3 Player for Windows
## Overview
This project was created out of frustration with YouTube's music mixer, which often suggests songs I don't like. I wanted a simple and customizable solution to listen to **my own downloaded music files**, without dealing with unwanted recommendations.

## Features
- Play your downloaded music files seamlessly.
- Lightweight and easy-to-use interface.
- No ads, no algorithms – just your music.

## Why I Built This
Streaming platforms and automated mixers like YouTube’s can sometimes miss the mark, throwing in songs that disrupt the vibe. I wanted full control over my listening experience, with a tool that simply plays the music I choose.
